<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm aspiring Web developer, aiming for sophisticated web pages neumorphism api. Aside from that I'm also an engineering student,
  that was curious about invention for helping those in need and especially for effiecient lifestyle, reducing repetitive task.
  Lately, I've been working with 3D modeling its quite fun and challenging, but you'll understand the relief ones to design your own
  project.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I also quite studying foreign languages German and Japanese; German feels really different the way I utter words its
  so weird, English is my second language by far, but to escalate with tounge twisting pronounciation is a array,
  yet japanese is another level to be said learning two dialects Hiragani and Katakana at the same time like piercing your brain in both sides
  in text Hiragani adapt more in Chinese character while Katakana is more like simple strokes and less complicated.</p>

<p>Moreover, I actually fond in reading Bible its another side of me: God abundantly both giving me staff and rod. I was really at awe when
   talking to His Majesty. Like these things are not possible without his help the way our life is, was at his hand, so we 
  better not take things for granted and dedicated walking to worship God alone, regardless how lamenting and dismmaying life could be.</p>
